      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a graduate of a technical high school specializing in information technology in Pila. I really enjoy creating games and finding bugs in them. I have several side projects that I would like to showcase here.</p>

          <h3>Discord bot</h3>
          <p>I enjoy watching the economy change right before my eyes. That's why I created a small bot for use on the Discord platform. The bot is designed to monitor a specific item on the marketplace in a certain game and has the highest tendency to change price by even several hundred percent.</p>

          <h3>KTD</h3>
          <p>This is my personal project in the Unity game engine. KTD is the working name - 'Kufel Tower Defense' There are many ideas for what to do with this game, such as towers, enemies, maps... The code is located in a private repository on my Github. I don't expect the game to look too visually appealing since I am not a very skilled artist.</p>

          <h3>School projects</h3>
          <p>Simple school projects that I intentionally kept. The projects utilize various programming languages such as PHP, JavaScript, some CSS styles, and MySQL databases.</p>

          <h3>This website</h3>
          <p>When reworking my CV n'th time, I thought that something was missing in it. After all, I couldn't showcase a bot, school projects, and a game in a condensed format. So, I created this website to showcase these things! You can see efects right now.</p>

          <h3>Bot na Discorda</h3>
          <p>Bardzo lubię patrzeć jak rynek zaczyna wariować, w tym pomógł mi bot na komunikator Discord wysyłający co jakiś czas ceny jednego specyficznego produktu z największą tendencją do zmiany ceny o nawet kilkaset procent z bazaru w pewnej grze. Bot ten pomógł też nam się wzbogacić mnożąc nasz wirtualny kapitał przy najlepszych warunkach przeszło STUKROTNIE.</p>
